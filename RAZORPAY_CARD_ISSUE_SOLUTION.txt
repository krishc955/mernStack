‚úÖ SUCCESS: Your API keys are now working correctly!
‚úÖ The 401 authentication error is resolved
‚ùå NEW ISSUE: International cards not supported

CURRENT ERROR: "International cards are not supported. Please contact our support team for help"

SOLUTION 1: Enable International Cards in Razorpay Dashboard
1. Go to: https://dashboard.razorpay.com/
2. Navigate to: Settings ‚Üí Configuration ‚Üí Payment Methods
3. Find "International Cards" section
4. Enable "International Cards" for test mode
5. Save settings

SOLUTION 2: Use Indian Test Cards Instead
Use these INDIAN test card numbers (guaranteed to work):

‚úÖ INDIAN TEST CARDS (NO REAL MONEY):
- Success Payment: 5555 5555 5555 4444 (Mastercard India)
- Success Payment: 4000 0035 6000 0008 (Visa India)
- Success Payment: 4111 1111 1111 1111 (Should work if international enabled)
- Failed Payment: 4000 0000 0000 0002
- CVV: Any 3 digits (123)
- Expiry: Any future date (12/25)

‚úÖ INDIAN UPI (ALWAYS WORKS):
- Success: success@razorpay
- Failure: failure@razorpay

SOLUTION 3: Use UPI Instead of Cards
UPI payments always work in test mode:
1. Select UPI payment option
2. Use: success@razorpay
3. Payment will succeed immediately

NEXT STEPS:
1. Try UPI payment: success@razorpay (quickest test)
2. Or enable international cards in dashboard
3. Or use Indian test card: 5555 5555 5555 4444

üéØ YOUR PAYMENT SYSTEM IS WORKING! Just need right test method.
