# Video Adding Error - Fix Applied

## Issue Identified
The "error adding video" was caused by **missing authentication middleware** on the video routes. This meant that when trying to add a video, the `req.user` object was undefined, causing the server to fail when trying to access `req.user.id` for the `addedBy` field.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Authentication Middleware to Video Routes
**File:** `server/routes/admin/video-routes.js`

**Before:**
```javascript
// Admin routes (protected) - BUT NOT ACTUALLY PROTECTED!
router.get("/admin/videos", getAllVideos);
router.post("/admin/videos/add", addVideo);
router.put("/admin/videos/update/:id", updateVideo);
router.delete("/admin/videos/delete/:id", deleteVideo);
router.patch("/admin/videos/toggle-status/:id", toggleVideoStatus);
```

**After:**
```javascript
const { authMiddleware } = require("../../controllers/auth/auth-controller");

// Admin routes (protected) - NOW ACTUALLY PROTECTED!
router.get("/admin/videos", authMiddleware, getAllVideos);
router.post("/admin/videos/add", authMiddleware, addVideo);
router.put("/admin/videos/update/:id", authMiddleware, updateVideo);
router.delete("/admin/videos/delete/:id", authMiddleware, deleteVideo);
router.patch("/admin/videos/toggle-status/:id", authMiddleware, toggleVideoStatus);
```

### 2. Facebook URL Support Already Fixed
The Facebook URL pattern matching was already updated in previous session to support the new format:
- `https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1VdtY6TReA/` âœ… Supported

## How to Test the Fix

### Step 1: Restart Your Server
```bash
cd server
npm start
```

### Step 2: Test Adding Video
1. Go to your admin panel: `http://localhost:5173/admin/videos`
2. Make sure you're logged in as an admin user
3. Click "Add Video" button
4. Fill in the form with:
   - **Title:** Test Facebook Video
   - **Video URL:** https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1VdtY6TReA/
   - **Platform:** Facebook
   - **Category:** Fashion
   - **Status:** Active
5. Click "Save"

### Step 3: Verify Success
- You should see a success message
- The video should appear in the admin videos list
- The video should display on your homepage at `/` under the social media section

## What Was Happening Before
1. User tries to add video through admin panel
2. Frontend sends POST request to `/api/admin/videos/add`
3. Server receives request but `req.user` is undefined (no auth middleware)
4. Video controller tries to access `req.user.id` and fails
5. Error occurs and video is not saved

## What Happens Now
1. User tries to add video through admin panel
2. Frontend sends POST request to `/api/admin/videos/add`
3. Auth middleware verifies token and populates `req.user`
4. Video controller successfully accesses `req.user.id`
5. Video is saved with proper user reference
6. Success response sent back to frontend

## Additional Notes
- All admin video routes now require valid authentication
- Facebook URL validation supports new share format
- Video model and database schema are correct
- Frontend admin panel properly sends auth tokens

The fix should resolve the "error adding video" issue completely!
