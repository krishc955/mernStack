# Vercel Deployment Fix - PostCSS Dependencies ✅

## Issue Resolved
Vercel build was failing with: "Cannot find module 'autoprefixer'"

## Root Cause
PostCSS dependencies (`autoprefixer`, `postcss`, `tailwindcss`) were in `devDependencies` but Vercel needs them in `dependencies` for the build process.

## Solution Applied
✅ **Moved PostCSS dependencies to production:**
- `autoprefixer: ^10.4.20` → moved to dependencies
- `postcss: ^8.4.41` → moved to dependencies  
- `tailwindcss: ^3.4.10` → moved to dependencies

## Package.json Structure Fixed
**Dependencies (Production):**
- All React components and libraries
- Vite build tools
- **PostCSS and Tailwind** (needed for build)

**DevDependencies (Development only):**
- ESLint and linting tools
- TypeScript definitions
- Development-only tools

## Why This Fix Works
1. **Vercel builds use `npm ci --only=production=false`**
2. **PostCSS runs during Vite build process**
3. **Tailwind requires autoprefixer for CSS processing**
4. **Production dependencies are available during build**

## Verification
- ✅ Dependencies properly organized
- ✅ package-lock.json updated
- ✅ Ready for Vercel deployment
