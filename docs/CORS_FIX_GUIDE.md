# 🚨 CORS Fix for Vinora Subdomain

## Problem
Your frontend at `https://www.vinora.royalappleshimla.com` cannot access your backend at `https://mernstack-7sfn.onrender.com` due to CORS policy.

## ✅ Solution Steps

### 1. Deploy Updated Server Code
The server CORS configuration has been updated to include your subdomain. You need to deploy these changes to Render:

```bash
# Commit and push the server changes
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Update CORS configuration for Vinora subdomain"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Update Render Environment Variables
In your Render dashboard for the backend service, add these environment variables:

```
CLIENT_BASE_URL=https://www.vinora.royalappleshimla.com
FRONTEND_URL=https://www.vinora.royalappleshimla.com
NODE_ENV=production
```

### 3. Redeploy Frontend
If you're using Vercel/Netlify, redeploy your frontend to use the updated API configuration:

```bash
# In the client directory
cd client
npm run build
# Then deploy the dist/ folder or push to trigger auto-deployment
```

### 4. Environment Variables for Frontend
Make sure your frontend deployment platform has:

```
VITE_API_URL=https://mernstack-7sfn.onrender.com
```

## 🔍 Verification

After deployment, check:

1. **Backend Logs**: Look for CORS messages in Render logs
2. **Browser Console**: Should show successful API calls
3. **Network Tab**: No more CORS errors

## ⚡ Quick Test

Open browser console on `https://www.vinora.royalappleshimla.com` and run:

```javascript
fetch('https://mernstack-7sfn.onrender.com/api/auth/check-auth', {
  method: 'GET',
  credentials: 'include'
}).then(response => console.log('✅ CORS working!', response))
.catch(error => console.log('❌ CORS still blocked:', error));
```

## 🎯 Expected Result

After these changes:
- ✅ No CORS errors in console
- ✅ Products load correctly
- ✅ Authentication works
- ✅ All API calls successful

The key was updating the server's CORS configuration to include your exact subdomain URLs!
