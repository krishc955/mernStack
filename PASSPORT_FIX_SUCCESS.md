# Passport.js Configuration Fix - SUCCESS ✅

## Issue Resolved
Server was failing to start with error: "passport.initialize is not a function"

## Root Cause
The `server/config/passport.js` file was completely empty, causing the import to fail when server tried to initialize passport middleware.

## Solution Applied

### Key Components Added:
1. **Google OAuth Strategy** - Handles authentication with Google
2. **User Serialization/Deserialization** - For session management  
3. **Profile Photo Import** - Captures and stores Google profile images
4. **User Creation/Update Logic** - Handles both new and existing users

### Configuration Details:
```javascript
- Google OAuth Strategy with proper callback URL
- Profile photo extraction from Google data
- Email-based user matching for existing accounts
- Automatic user creation for new Google accounts
- Proper error handling and logging
```
